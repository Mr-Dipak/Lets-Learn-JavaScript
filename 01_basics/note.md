# JavaScript Terminologies

## Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

## Data Types
JavaScript supports different data types including:
- **String**: Represents textual data. Example: `"Hello"`
- **Number**: Represents numeric values. Example: `42`
- **Boolean**: Represents logical values. Example: `true` or `false`
- **Object**: Represents complex data structures. Example: `{ name: "John", age: 30 }`
- **Array**: Represents a list of values. Example: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has not been assigned a value.
- **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

## Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Examples include:
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

## Functions
Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. They are defined using the `function` keyword.

## Control Structures
Control structures are used to determine the flow of control in a program. Examples include:
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `else if`, `else`
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do...while`

## Events
Events are actions that can be detected by JavaScript, such as user interactions or browser actions. Examples include `onclick`, `onload`, `onchange`.

## Objects
Objects are collections of properties and methods. Properties are values associated with an object, and methods are functions that belong to an object.

## Scope
Scope determines the accessibility of variables and functions in different parts of the code. JavaScript has function scope and block scope.

## Closures
Closures are functions that have access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

## Promises
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They represent a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never.

## Async/Await
`async` and `await` are used to handle promises more efficiently, making asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.

## DOM (Document Object Model)
The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

## ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)
ES6 introduced new features to JavaScript, including `let` and `const`, arrow functions, template literals, classes, and modules.

## Hoisting
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope.

## Event Loop
The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

## Callbacks
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, to be executed once an operation is completed.

## Arrow Functions
Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing function expressions and do not have their own `this` context.

## Modules
Modules allow you to break up your code into separate files and import/export them as needed.
